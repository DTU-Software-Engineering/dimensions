  abstract =     { Formal Concept Analysis, developed during the last
                  fifteen years, has been based on the dyadic
                  understanding of a concept constituted by its
                  extension and its intension. The pragmatic
                  philosophy of Charles S. Peirce with his three
                  universal categories, and experiences in data
                  analysis, have suggested a triadic approach to
                  Formal Concept Analysis. This approach starts with
                  the primitive notion of a triadic context defined as
                  a quadruple (G, M, B, Y) where G, M, and B are sets
                  and Y is a ternary relation between G, M, and B,
                  i.e. Y subset of or equal to G x M x B; the elements
                  of G, M, and B are called objects, attributes, and
                  conditions, respectively, and (g, m, b) is an
                  element of Y is read: the object g has the attribute
                  m under(or according to) the condition b. A triadic
                  concept of a triadic context (G, M, B, Y) is defined
                  as a triple (A(1), A(2), A(3)) With A(1) x A(2) x
                  A(3) subset of or equal to Y which is maximal with
                  respect to component-wise inclusion. The triadic
                  concepts are structured by three quasiorders given
                  by the inclusion order within each of the three
                  components. In analogy to the dyadic case, we
                  discuss how the ordinal structure of the triadic
                  concepts of a triadic context can be analysed and
                  graphically represented. A basic result is that
                  those structures can be understood
                  order-theoretically as ''complete trilattices'' up
                  to isomorphism. },

  abstract =     { "Concept Lattice" is the central notion of "Formal
                  Concept Analysis," a new area of research which is
                  based on a set-theoretical model for concepts and
                  conceptual hierarchies. This model yields not only a
                  new approach to data analysis but also methods for
                  formal representation of conceptual knowledge. These
                  methods are outlined on three levels. First, basics
                  on concept lattices are explained starting from
                  simple data contexts which consist of a binary
                  relation between objects and attributes indicating
                  which object has which attribute. On the second
                  level, conceptual relationships are discussed for
                  data matrices which assign attribute values to each
                  of the given objects. Finally, a mathematical model
                  for conceptual knowledge systems is described. This
                  model allows us to study mathematically the
                  representation, inference, acquisition, and
                  communication of conceptual knowledge. },
