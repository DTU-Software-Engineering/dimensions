Developing a Theory for Software Engineering:
Intuitions, Observations, and Hypotheses

Intuition
	Lack of criteria when to use which method given some circumstances/constraints/context conditions
	Goal: A theory on the level V of the Gregor-scale
Observations
	Ekkart's Dimensions (Bottom Up)
	Harald's Conceptual Connection (Top Down)
	Joe's Formal Framework (Whatever)
	
Hypotheses & Predictions
	Being able to describe all (common) sw. development methods [what about "...all phenomena"?]
	Anne: Having such a theory will help understand why/how methods work (or don't work)
	Harald: Having such a theory will allow us to compare methods with each other, and thus will allow us to better choose a suitable one
	Ekkart: Size/Distance of Artefacts ("Breadcrumbs")

Outlook
	Explore further existing sources (practitioners, experts, scientists,...literature, tools, ...) to contribute to building hypotheses
	Develop Theory to greater comprehensiveness/detailedness
	Operationalize hypotheses so they can be falsified/validated
